# NixOS module for River 0.4.0+ (AKA `river-next`)
River development has undergone drastic changes, with new design principles, compared to 0.3.x and prior. It doesn't yet have an official release. However, it is in a state that runs well. Still, given the frequent changes, it's not something that would find a place in Nixpkgs yet. One can only find `river-classic` (0.3.x) in the repo.

Rather than wait for the release, I wanted to build it locally now, to try out the changes. Plus, given how the compositor works, a dozen or so of window managers would need to be packaged to actually run something in `river-next`. This repository does exactly that: it builds the new River package, along with all supported window managers (see below) and a NixOS module. 

I plan to update packages roughly once a week, ideally on Mondays. Package versions (aside from River) will reflect this if they receive changes. Later I plan to adjust this to update based on their actual commit histories.  
**Last package update: 16-03-2026.**

## Importing
To install the module, you can do the following (assumes npins installation, but others can work just fine too):
+ Run `npins add --name "river-next" github dmkhitaryan river-next-nix-module -b main`
+ Add `river-next = sources.river-next;` in a `let` statement in your configuration (or don't!).
+ Import the module either by adding `"${river-next}/river-module.nix"` or `(import river-next).nixosModule` in your `imports`. 

## Notes
Please note that all the packages here are pulling changes against their respective main branches. For window managers in particular, some are further along in development than others. Therefore, the risk of experiencing a breaking change may vary, **but it is always non-zero**!

Furthermore, it is highly recommended for users with multi-monitor setups to to configure outputs via tools like `kanshi` (see the module config). This is because not all window managers support output management on their own, which will lead to incorrectly positioned windows or even crashes altogether.

(17-03-2026): `reka`'s desktop session entry now works as intended. However, note that it **will not launch via GDM**. TTY or something similar like `ly` will launch it correctly, though.  
Might just be a "GDM moment", but I do not plan to investigate further. That said, below are some tips:
  1. If you are going to launch it through TTY, run `exec /nix/store/...river-reka-launcher` and enjoy.
  2. If running through `ly` or similar, look for the *River (Reka)* entry in the session list. Select it, log in, and enjoy.
